/**
 * The parts a plugin holds, read off the copy on this host's disk.
 *
 * A client hands a session a plugin as a URI and a revision, and the host copies
 * it to a directory here before any backend can open it. What the plugin holds
 * is read here: its agents, skills, rules, hooks and MCP servers, as the
 * `children` of its entry in the session's customizations. A client reads that
 * list to show what a plugin brings, and switches one of its servers off from it.
 *
 * Two formats are read, which are the two a plugin is handed over in: a Claude
 * plugin, whose manifest is `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and an Open Plugins
 * one, whose manifest is `.plugin/plugin.json`. A directory with neither is a
 * plugin this host lists with no parts rather than one it guesses a format for.
 * Both formats keep their hooks in `hooks/hooks.json` and their servers in
 * `.mcp.json`, and both let the manifest move any of that or declare it inline.
 *
 * A part is named the way VS Code's agent host names one: by the URI of its own
 * file inside this copy, and that URI is the part's id as well. The copy is what
 * is read, so the copy is what a part is named by, and a client that reads one
 * reads the file the host would. A server has no file of its own - several sit
 * in one - so the URI of the file that declares it carries the server's name in
 * a fragment, which is what tells two servers of one file apart.
 *
 * A rule is read past its name: its file's frontmatter becomes fields of its
 * part - what the rule is for, whether it always applies, and the files it
 * applies to - and the text below it is kept beside the part rather than in it,
 * because a client is told what a rule is for and not the words of it.
