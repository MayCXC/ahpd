 * What `ahpd join` does, seen from the hub's own end.

 * The hub is a port that answers every dial and holds every line, so each case
 * is what the node sent and what it did with what it was sent. The node is the
 * real program in another process, and so is the host each session is served
 * by: the point of these cases is the pipe between the two, and a stand-in on
