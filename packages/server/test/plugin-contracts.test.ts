/*
 * Every plugin this repository ships loads under its own contracts.
 *
 * The contracts are in the `ahpd` field of the package.json the loader reads,
 * and the check runs at the moment the plugin registers: a name the list does
 * not cover fails that plugin's load, so a load with no contract problem is
 * the list being complete.
 *
 * Each package is loaded as a copy of its package.json whose entry re-exports
 * its `src`, because the tests run before `pnpm build` and the loader refuses
 * an entry outside the package.
